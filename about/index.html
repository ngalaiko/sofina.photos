Here I was lucky enough to meet a number of amazing teachers who opened my eyes to the world of art and design;
this would alter the path of my life in more ways than I could ever imagine.</p><p>After studying studio art and environmental science at the University of Vermont,
I moved to Lake Tahoe, California, in hopes of becoming a professional snowboarder (graduating right after the
&lsquo;08 recession made this seem like a great idea). A couple of years and too many injuries later,
I found myself taking up an offer to photograph a few homes for a client I&rsquo;d met while recuperating.
What started by chance turned out to be the perfect mix of technical challenge and creative outlet,
and I decided right there and then that it absolutely must be my career.</p><p>In 2018, I founded the Architectural Photography Almanac, a resource for architecture photographers and those in
the architecture industry seeking to learn about the craft and theory of architectural photography.</p><p>Clients include:</p><ul><li>Herman Miller</li><li>Tesla Motors</li><li>Arquitectonica</li><li>Mark Cavagnero Associates</li><li>Pozas Arquitectos</li></ul><p>Publications include:</p><ul><li>National Geographic</li><li>WIRED</li><li>Travel + Leisure</li><li>BBC</li><li>Fast Company</li><li>Wall Street Journal</li></ul><p>Recent Awards + Exhibits:</p><ul><li>2019: Museum of Design, Zurich: Knowledge in Images â€“ Information Design Today, Airportraits</li><li>2019: Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing: Civilization, The Way we Live Now, Airportraits</li><li>2018: Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Seoul, SK: Civilization, The Way we Live Now, Airportraits</li><li>2018: Nordic Museum, Seattle: Innovations in Icelandic Design, Architecture of Iceland</li><li>2018: AIA LA Honor Award: Architectural Photography, LA Airspace</li><li>2018: Auckland Airport, Airportraits, Solo Exhibit, International Terminal</li><li>2017: OUE Skyspace, Los Angeles: LA Airspace</li><li>2017: SFO Museum: Solo Exhibit, Airportraits</li><li>2015: AIA LA: Solo Exhibit, The Architecture of Iceland</li><li>2014: A+D Museum: Groundswell</li></ul></div></article></main></body></html>
