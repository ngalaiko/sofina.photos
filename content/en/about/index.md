I'm a photographer based in Los Angeles, California who specializes in photographing architecture; I also have a mild airplane obsession.

I grew up in Ipswich, Massachusetts: a small coastal town that's one part postcard and one part dramatic Boston movie.
Here I was lucky enough to meet a number of amazing teachers who opened my eyes to the world of art and design;
this would alter the path of my life in more ways than I could ever imagine. 

After studying studio art and environmental science at the University of Vermont, 
I moved to Lake Tahoe, California, in hopes of becoming a professional snowboarder (graduating right after the
'08 recession made this seem like a great idea). A couple of years and too many injuries later,
I found myself taking up an offer to photograph a few homes for a client I'd met while recuperating.
What started by chance turned out to be the perfect mix of technical challenge and creative outlet,
and I decided right there and then that it absolutely must be my career. 

In 2018, I founded the Architectural Photography Almanac, a resource for architecture photographers and those in
the architecture industry seeking to learn about the craft and theory of architectural photography.
